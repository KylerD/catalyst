## Catalyst Template

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app) and setup with the following libraries:

- [Daisy UI](https://daisyui.com/) - A tailwind style library which is great for simple components and consistent theming
- [shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com/) - A tailwind component library which is great for more complicated components

Typically, only one of these libraries would be necessary, but they can be combined together for faster prototyping.

- [Vercel AI SDK](https://sdk.vercel.ai/docs/introduction) - Vercel AI SDK provides a set of utility components over common AI interactions, particuarly with chat capabilities.

- [Zod](https://zod.dev/) - Form Validation
- [Zustand](https://zustand.docs.pmnd.rs/) - State Mgmt

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
